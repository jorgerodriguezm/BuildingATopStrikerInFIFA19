### Determining the Key Factors for Developing a Top Striker in FIFA

### Problem

The purpose of this repository is to find the top traits that have the most influence in the Finishing score of a footballer so that players can best invest their skill points.

### Solution

In order to solve this, we would make use of machine learning python libraries (numpy, pandas,and sklearn) to make a simple exploratory data analysis and visualization. Later, we would make a linear regression model double checking its acurracy with key metrics and finalize with the testing of our model with some values of the found traits.
